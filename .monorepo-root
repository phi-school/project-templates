# .monorepo-root

This file serves as a marker to indicate the root directory of the monorepo. It
does not contain any configuration or settings; its mere presence is used by
scripts and tooling to programmatically identify the root of the monorepo.

Committing to Source Control: 

It is essential to commit the `.monorepo-root`
file to source control to ensure consistent behavior across different
environments and for all team members. This way, any clone of the repository
will have this file, allowing scripts and tools to correctly identify the
monorepo root, regardless of the environment they are run in.
